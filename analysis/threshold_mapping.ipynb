    "### Explanation of remaining inconsistency of distance analyses between main analysis and post hoc reshold analysis here\n",
    "There is a small but fundamental difference taken in the main analysis and the threshold analysis above with regard to evaluation of distances and thresholds; the estimates for population within threshold presented above reflect this through small difference in results for public transport and public open space access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main analysis, after deriving 'full distances' for sample points we were primarily interested not in the recorded distance but rather whether this was within (<=) 500m or not.  This was evaluated, averaged to hexagon grids, then the percentage of population with access was evaluated as the population weighted average of hexagon access scores at the city level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the post hoc threshold analysis, the specific recorded distances at the hex level are of interest.  To estimate these, average distances need to be estimated grouped by hexagon identifier.  However, where null values exist for sample point distances (evaluated as 0 for access in the main analysis, as opposed to 1) these need to be accounted for some how: they signify some uncertain degree of distance beyond 500m which was not recorded. To do this in the post hoc threshold analysis we used 650m as a plug in approximation of distance, representing an optimistic view of what average access beyond this distance might be.  While some sample points' distance to nearest destination of interest would be less than this had it been recorded, many would be expected to be further and some much so.  After aggregation, to facilitate plotting of histograms all hexagons with average distance in excess of 500m are set equal to 650m and represented in the plot as \">\", indicative that the true value in excess of 500m is uncertain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the difference is that the main analysis evaluates access within 500m for sample points and then aggregates to hexagons with weights by population, while the threshold analysis estimated average distance within each hexagon (with some assumptions) and subsequently relates these to thresholds before weighting by population.  If the assumptions had not been made (ie. 650m as a stand in for distances not measured due to being further than analysed), then the average distances calculated for hexagons would have been underestimated.  Hence the final results are simliar, but may differ by a few percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "A proposed solution might be, when presenting 'distance within 500m' we use the main analysis results for consistency; we could otherwise note that due to the different methods employed the multiple threshold analysis of distance results may vary slightly from the binary result."
