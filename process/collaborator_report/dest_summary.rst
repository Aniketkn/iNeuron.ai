Destination summary
===================

The following tables (overleaf) describe the preliminary data gathered using the open data sources described above for each study region.  

Table 1 summarises for each city a population estimate (with caveat, see footnote), the area of the city's urban region used for analysis, and destination counts for the following categories: 'Supermarkets, Fresh food, market'; 'Convenience stores' ; 'Public transport stops (any mode)'.

For conciseness, in the remainder of the document these destination categories will be refered to using the respective shorter names of 'Fresh Food / Market', 'Convenience', and 'Public transport stop'.

Table 2 provides for each of the the statistic columns in Table 1 a listing of the percentile breakpoints: 0th (the minimum value observed), 25th , 50th (the median observed value), 75th, and 100th (the maximum value observed).  This can be used in order to get a sense of how the results for your city found in Table 1 are positioned, relative to those of other cities.
