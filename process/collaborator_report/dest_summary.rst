Destination summary
===================

The following tables (overleaf) describe the preliminary data gathered using the open data sources described above for each study region, or include additional custom destinations where these have been provided due to lack of appropriate representation of destination categories using open data, following consultation with local experts.  

Table 1 summarises for each city a population estimate (with caveat, see footnote), the area of the city's urban region used for analysis, and destination counts for the following categories: 'Supermarkets, Fresh food, market'; 'Convenience stores' ; 'Public transport stops (any mode)'. 

For conciseness, in the remainder of the document these destination categories will be refered to using the respective shorter names of 'Fresh Food / Market', 'Convenience', and 'Public transport stop'.
