Destination tags
================

Destination categories have been coded using key-value pair terms.  Please see the 'About' section for more information, including links to guidelines for these categories and for country specific coding guidelines.

Public transport stop (any)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is planned to use General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data where available for public transport analysis.  However, GTFS data is not available for all cities, so additional analysis will be undertaken for all cities using OSM public transport data.

Public Open Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The identification of public open space using OpenStreetMap is a distinct question to other kinds of destinations which are usually localised as discrete 'points': public open space are areas (or polygons), and often may be quite large.    Parks, nature reserves, plazas and squares could all be considered areas of open space: open areas where people may gather for leisure.

Going into the full detail of the methods which we use to derive areas of open space using OpenStreetMap is beyond the scope of this report.  The publication of the method described below is forthcoming, please contact carl.higgs@rmit.edu.au if you have any further questions.

However the basic workflow is as follows:

Exclusion criteria
##################

We create a polygon layer of areas which are categorically not to be considered as open space.  For example, if there is an area which has been coded to suggest it could be a natural area that might potentially be an open space (e.g. perhaps 'boundary=nature_reserve'), but actually is within a military zone: this is not an area of public open space and will be excluded.

landuse          military

Open space
##########

A series of logical queries are used to identify areas of open space; meeting any one of these is grounds for inclusion of consideration as a potential area of open space (noting that this may yet include private areas, which are not public open space).:

Specific inclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* leisure IS NOT NULL

* natural IS NOT NULL

* sport IS NOT NULL

* beach IS NOT NULL

* river IS NOT NULL

* water IS NOT NULL

* waterway IS NOT NULL

* wetland IS NOT NULL

* place  =  'square'

* highway = 'pedestrian'

In addition, if the the following keys have any of the listed values:

* landuse: common, conservation, forest, garden, leisure, park, pitch, recreation_ground, sport, trees, village_green, winter_sports, wood, dog_park, nature_reserve, off_leash , sports_centre,

* os_boundary: protected_area, national_park, nature_reserve, forest, water_protection_area, state_forest, state_park, regional_park, park, county_park

Any portions of the above areas overlapping areas identified as being 'excluded' are omitted from the open space dataset.

Evaluating access
#################

Once areas of public open space have been identified, proxy locations for entry points are created at regular intervals on the sections of the boundaries of those areas of public open space which are within 30 metres of the road network.
