# configuration   
This is where the configuration files for each city are kept. These are .json files which are the configuration for a particular city and the cities that will go into the aggregation script.  

- CityName.json â€“ This is a configuration file for a single city that will serve as the input for the Sample Point creation script. Each city requires its own .json file, e.g.: melbourne.json.    

- cities.json - There is one additional .json configuration file other than the city files, which is used as a configuration file for the aggregation level of coding. This file defines which cities should server as the input for the aggregations statistics (city and intercity).
