# Configuration

This is where the configuration files for each city are kept.

- CityName.py â€“ This is a configuration file for a single city that will serve as the input for the Sample Point creation script. Each city requires its own .py file, e.g.: melbourne.py.

- cities.json - There is one additional .json configuration file other than the city files, which is used as a configuration file for the aggregation level of coding. This file defines which cities should server as the input for the aggregations statistics (city and intercity).

**Create these files by running `/process/setup_config.py`.**
