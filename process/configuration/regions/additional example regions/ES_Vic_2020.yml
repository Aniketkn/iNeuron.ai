notes: Vic appears to be well represented for its size and population with OSM destinations, however unlike all other cities it does not intersect an 'urban area' identified by the Global Human Settlements dataset.  In this regard, it should be noted that Vic is exceptional compared with other cities, which were all identified as being largely 'urban'.
