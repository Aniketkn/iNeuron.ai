# Policy review data

The global-indicators software is designed to report on policy and spatial indicator results.  The integration of policy results is in development, and pending an updated policy review survey instrument.  The beta implementation has been carried out using the policy review analysis used in the 25-city study published in 2022, and draft templates are available on request.  It is anticipated that the updated policy review instrument will be incorporated for reporting purposes later in 2023.
