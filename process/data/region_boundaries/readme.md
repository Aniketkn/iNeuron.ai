# Region boundary data

Region boundary data are used to identify the study region(s) of interest.

Sub-folders within this folder can be used to group relevant boundary files, which may be geopackage files containing a layer that corresponds to the region of interest or otherwise can support a query to identify that region (as per configuration in regions.yml).

Examples of storage of boundaries within this folder include:

- Belgium/adminvector_3812.gpkg
- Belgium/ghent_3812.geojson
- ghent_3812.geojson

Metadata for the stored boundary data should be recorded in regions.yml.
