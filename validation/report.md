### Literature Review
Over the past decade, the internet has transitioned from an emphasis on users consuming predefined content to users contributing and sharing content (O’Reilly 2005). When working with geodata, quality is often defined by pre-established parameters that have been compiled over the years. In the field of geo-information, the principles of the International Organization for Standardization are taken as a standard of quality assessment. The OpenStreetMap Project (OSM) emerged from this growing emphasis on user-generated content. OSM is a system based on volunteered geographic information (VGI), which is often questioned with regards to the quality of the content of the provided spatial data (Girres and Touya 2010). OSM has produced a large amount of spatial data. However, because most of its contributors are volunteers or aficionados from diverse backgrounds who may lack training in geographical information science standards and methods, quality has always been a concern (Singh Sehra et al. 2020). Numerous scientific studies have focused on evaluating OSM data quality. Over time, various approaches have been developed as technological advancements have provided new tools that have resulted in more complex quality assessment methods. 
 
Since OSM started in London in August of 2004, an early study by Haklay (2010) utilizes London and England as its study area. The research focused on analyzing its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey datasets. An evaluation of the positional and attribute accuracy, completeness, and consistency provided an early indication of the quality of VGI. For this study, two elements of the possible range of quality were measured: positional accuracy and completeness. For comparison, only streets and roads were used. These are the main features collected by OSM volunteers. Junctions are collapsed to single nodes and multi-carriageways to individual links. High-resolution mapping (1:1250 urban areas, 1:2500 in rural areas, 1:10 000 in moorland), avoiding minor roads and cul-de-sacs. A grid at a resolution of 1 km was created across England. The rest of the analysis was carried out through SQL queries, which added up the length of lines that were contained in or intersected the grid cells (Haklay 2010).
 
In order to assess the completeness of OSM data, a visual comparison with aerial imagery, and fitting parametric models regarding the historical growth of the OSM street network was presented in 2017 by Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball. Globally, OSM is 83% complete, and more than 40% of countries have fully mapped street networks. The most notable finding is that completeness has a U-shaped relationship with density. Inter-urban roads that traverse areas with minimal population are primarily present in OSM and high-density regions with a large number of contributors. Communities that are most likely to have missing streets are smaller towns and villages. After obtaining estimates of completeness, the length of the road network in each country was obtained by dividing the existing length of mapped roads in OSM by the estimated fraction complete. The visual assessment was based on a stratified and probability-weighted sample of 45 points in each country. The sampling algorithm in QGIS selected a random point and overlays streets in the OSM database against aerial or satellite imagery provided by Google through the OpenLayersplugin, at a scale of 1:5000. The model also provided estimates of the number of road edges, which were then used to weight each grid cell when aggregating the grid-cell fraction complete predictions to the country level (Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball 2017). 
 
Extending the previous work by Haklay (2010), an article that studies the quality of French OpenStreetMap data provides a larger set of spatial data quality element assessments and uses different quality control methods. Comparisons were made between the OSM data and BD TOPO Large Scale Referential (RGE) data (reference datasets with a metric resolution) to assess: geometric accuracy; attribute accuracy; completeness; logical consistency; semantic accuracy; temporal accuracy; lineage; and usage. The results raise questions such as the heterogeneity of processes, scales of production, and the compliance to standardized and accepted specifications limiting the possible applications. Finding a balance between specifications and contributor freedom is raised, proposing new research such as contributors’ assistance with automatic checking of contributions (Girres and Touya 2010).
 
A framework containing more than 25 methods and indicators is presented, allowing OSM quality assessments based solely on the data’s history (OSM-Full- History-Dump). In lieu of a reference dataset, approximate statements on OSM data quality are possible. No ground truth reference dataset is deployed for OSM data quality evaluation. For example, an intrinsic analysis approach is applied in specified areas within OSM that can be evaluated by investigating the data’s historical development and comparing features’ characteristics at different timestamps. In order to assess the OSM data, the calculated results of the iOSMAnalyzer are divided into the following categories: fitness for purpose; general information on the study area; routing and navigation; geocoding; points of interest-search; map-applications; and user information and behavior. The calculated results give a compact quality overview of a freely selectable area. Quality depends on the individual use case, and the OSM data is evaluated in terms of fitness for purpose. However, absolute statements on data quality are only possible with a high-quality reference dataset as a basis for comparison. The study revealed that the interpretation of quality indicators is facilitated and supported by means of contributor activity (Barron et al., 2014). 
 
Multiple studies have focused on the completeness of OSM road datasets. Using both Street Map and Street View, Zhou and Lin (2019), focus on determining OSM road completeness and omission roads. An omitted road is classified into three types: public roads; private roads; and roads for non-motorized vehicles. The study employs an approach proposed by Zhou and Tian (2018). This approach includes the use of geometric indicators to estimate the quantitative completeness of street blocks in OSM. The authors analyze the completeness of street blocks in an OSM dataset by comparing them with a reference map. The method extracts OSM road datasets and converts them into several street blocks that are then visually compared with the Baidu Street Map. The analysis of omission roads is then determined by randomly selecting 60 incomplete street block from the OSM road dataset, overlapping it with the corresponding Baidu Street Map, and then manually digitizing all the omission roads in each of these street blocks. The research results indicate that most of the omitted roads were private roads, or one single lane, public roads, of lower importance within the urban road network. For 13 out of the 16 prefecture-level divisions, street block completeness values were lower than 40%, and the maximum value was only 55%. However, in roads with traffic conditions, 14 out of the 16 prefectures, street block completeness values were higher than 80%. These values indicate that major roads have been adequately mapped. The results also suggest that in terms of road length, approximately 90% of omission roads were either public roads or one private lane roads, of which no more than 10% were for non-motorized vehicles (Zhou and Lin 2019).
 
A similar approach is taken by Antunes et al. (2015). In the study, they assessed the positional differences between the road-network available in OSM for some regions of the Coimbra Municipality in Portugal, and the data provided by the Coimbra City Hall, as reference (REF). A subset of the original OSM is extracted so that its line features have a direct correspondent in REF; discrepancies are then removed. This process is achieved by applying a buffer around REF and comparing the angular coefficients of REF and OSM line features. Finally, by returning, per cell, the length and length percentage of OSM having a deviation smaller than a user-specified threshold value, and the maximum deviation between OSM and REF datasets (Antunes et al. 2015).
 
A study conducted by Dorn et al. in Southern Germany, focuses on two spatial data quality elements: thematic accuracy and completeness area addressed by comparing the OSM data with an authoritative German reference dataset. They were investigating the accuracy of VGI, derived from the OSM dataset. The study area is the Rhine- Neckar region, located in southern Germany. The comparison is executed through a semantic harmonization and a polygon preprocessing part that leads to an area related map comparison with a confusion matrix. Inconsistencies were previously solved to allow comparisons using kappa statistics or Cohen’s kappa coefficients after merging all polygons. The kappa value indicates a substantial agreement between both datasets, quantifying the agreement between images. The DLM data shows a large area is covered by farmland and forest. There are definite variations between each location. The forest area presents the highest accuracy and completeness (97.6%) and correctness (95.1%), while the farmland indicates low completeness (45.9%) but high correctness (94.8%). The western part of the study area is more urbanized and, therefore, well mapped. This condition may explain why the eastern section still lacks completeness. The quality of OSM land use and land cover features varies between the investigated classes (Dorn et al., 2015).
 
Extending the Quantum GIS processing toolbox's capabilities for assessing spatial data, a study by Singh Sehra et al. addresses the research gap regarding insufficient established methods to assess the quality of OSM data. Two types of representation of road networks are used. The first is primal that defines a two-dimensional graph where edges intersect only at nodes. The second is a dual presentation, where the dual graph represents roads as nodes and intersections as edges. The model developed an analysis of the topological errors and corrections using the following steps: layer re-projection to convert the layer into UTM; removes micro-segments using a threshold value of 1m, the vertices are pruned if the topology is maintained; removes dangles, using a threshold of 3m; performs line features snapping to a vertex a threshold of 3m; removes duplicate geometry features; removes lines features of zero length; and for any intersections, it validates closed holes and fixes node ordering. The research added functionality to convert shapefile data of the road network into a  multidigraph representation. The results conclude that even the proprietary road data sets are not free from logical inconsistencies and data contributed by the general public is credible. The study developed models and scripts to assess logical consistency based on three components: geographical topological consistency; semantic information (tags); and structural topological consistency or morphological consistency. Developing easy-to-use workflow models to assess OSM data (Singh Sehra et al., 2020).

### Why
To run the process and main analysis for the project, the research team extracted data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) drawing on study region boundaries derived from local administrative boundaries and the Global Human Settlements (GHS) urban localities database. The datasets derived for each city arising from this process aim to provide consistent and even analysis of all 25 urban areas. To assess the extent to which the OSM derived dataset accurately reflects the real world, the research team devised three phases of validation. 

**Phase** I validation involved a qualitative analysis conducted by partners based in each of the 25 urban areas. A descriptive report of the preliminary assets prepared for each study region (e.g. the urban area’s boundaries, distribution of amenities of interest,  etc.) was reviewed by collaborators with local area knowledge.  Feedback on data accuracy, completeness and suggestions for improvement was solicited through a Google Forms survey for each study region, with revisions undertaken as required based on feedback received.

**Phase II** validation comprised a quantitative analysis conducted by the researcher team for a selection of the 25 urban areas. Phase II validation compares data provided by local partners with the OSM derived data. While neither dataset is a perfect representation of reality, comparing the two helps give an understanding of which, if either, has better street coverage, and how this will impact the results of the project.  Ultimately, by comparing the official datasets compiled by local partners with the OSM derived data, the hope is to understand how similar the OSM data is to reality.

**Phase III** validation is quantitative analysis conducted by the researcher team for a selection of the 25 urban areas. By running the main analytical process on both the OSM derived datasets and the official datasets compiled by partners, it is possible to understand the material differences between the two. 

### Methods
For Phase II validation official datasets compiled by local partners, or official datasets, were collected for the following cities: Belfast, Hong Kong, Olomouc, and Sao Paulo. The data was then divided into edge data and destination data. Official edge datasets include the urban street network and were compared to the OSM derived street network dataset. Official destination datasets include supermarkets and similar establishments and were compared to the OSM derived food destination dataset. 

Official edge data was collected from Belfast, Hong Kong, and Olomouc. Generally, the official edge data did not include pedestrian paths. Additionally, in Hong Kong’s case, due to out-dated expression of its coordinate values, the edge data x and y coordinates were switched and needed to be corrected for analysis. Additionally, in Olomouc’s case, the projection metadata in the edge shapefile was inputted incorrectly as EPSG 5513 instead of EPSG 5514, leading the edge data’s geographies in Russia instead of the Czech Republic. These errors in projection support the use of open source data where coordinate reference systems are well-established and well-documented for reusability and replication like OSM. OSM’s data has a format and expectations when inputting metadata that is standard globally. OSM makes analysis of street networks more feasible because it allows for researchers to compare ‘apples to apples’. 

Official destination data was collected from Belfast, Olomouc, and Sao Paulo. The official data for Olomouc and Sao Paulo is in point form. Each point is tied to the centroid of the parcel that the destination corresponds to. The official data for Belfast is expressed in polygon form. The polygon data from Belfast is parcel data that different relevant destinations are tied to.  Because the Belfast dataset is polygon data, and the destination data collected from OSM is point data, the Belfast data was not usable for accessibility analysis. Therefore, the project only conducted Phase II validation for Olomouc and Sao Paulo’s destination data. Additionally, the Sao Paulo data was edited down to disclude farmer’s markets so that the comparison between the Official data and the OSM data was more consistent. These roadblocks further prove the advantages of using global open source datasets like the OSM extracted data used for this project. The global dataset makes global analysis feasible by having uniform data standards and data types.  

Three scripts are used to calculate the indicators that compare the OSM derived dataset and the Official datasets.  The scripts were divided by functionality and include edge validation, destination validation, and hexbin destination validation. All three scripts function similarly, so when they are run, they create a CSV of the indicators and a figure or figures of the data for each of the relevant cities.  Each script defines a set of functions and then runs through, creating the indicators that are then populated in the CSV. Additionally, the data and configuration folders are accessed by all three scripts. The configuration files allow the code to be flexible in which cities are included in the analysis by accessing file paths specific to each urban area.  

The edge script has functions to load in the data, plot the data, count the total amount of edges for each dataset, count the summed total length of edge data for each dataset, and calculate the proportion of edges that overlap from one dataset to another using buffers of 10 and 50 meters to return a total of twelve indicators. 

The first function, **load_data**, loads in the correct data by pulling file paths from the configuration files, and it extracts the appropriate data layers for edge analysis.  Then, it ensures that all of the data is projected in the correct CRS. Next, it clips the data to the study region. Finally, it asserts that all the data is projected in the same CRS.  The next function, **plot_data**, creates a figure of the study area. Then, the clipped and correctly projected Official data is plotted. Next, it plots the clipped and correctly projected OSM derived data on top. This highlights where only Official edges exist. The OSM edges are plotted in yellow and the Official edges are plotted in red. The next function, **total_edge_length_count**, finds the sum of the length of all the edges for a dataset. Then, it finds the total count of edges for the same dataset. The last function, **calculate_overlap**,  buffers each dataset by a predetermined buffer. Currently, the code buffers for 10 and 50 meters. Then it creates the unary union for both datasets. Third, it finds the intersection of the two unioned buffered datasets. Fourth, it divides this overlapping area with the area of the unioned buffer of each dataset. This finding becomes an indicator labeled with the appropriate dataset, area percent, and the buffer distance. For example, *osm_area_pct_10*, is the percent of the unioned buffered OSM edges that overlap with unioned buffered official data when all data is buffered by 10 meters. The process is then repeated, except for the percentage of the length of the edges that fall within the buffered area. This finding becomes an indicator labeled with the appropriate dataset, length percent, and the buffer distance. For example, *osm_length_pct_10*, is the percent of the length of unioned OSM edges that overlap with unioned buffered Official edges when they are buffered by 10 meters. 

The destination script has functions to load in the data, find the urban core, plot the data, and find the amount of overlap between destinatinations. 

The first function, **load_data**, loads in the correct data by pulling file paths from the configuration files, and it extracts the appropriate data layers for destination analysis. Then, it ensures that all of the data is projected in the correct CRS. Next, it clips the data to the study region. Finally, it asserts that all the data is projected in the same CRS.  The second function, **get_core_dests**, finds the geographical extents of the study area. It then finds the distance between the northernmost points and southernmost point and the distance between the easternmost and westernmost points. Next, it takes one tenth of the shorter distance. Finally, it finds the destinations within the negative buffer of this value. The third function, **plot_city_data**, creates a figure of the study area. Then, the clipped and correctly projected Official data is plotted. Next, it plots the clipped and correctly projected OSM derived data on top. This highlights where only Official destinations exist. The OSM destinations are plotted in yellow and the Official destinations are plotted in red. The fourth function, **plot_core_data**, follows the same process, but only for destinations that occur within the negative buffered area. The fifth function, **calculate_intersect**, buffers each destination from both datasets by a predetermined buffer. Currently, the code buffers for 10 and 50 meters. Then the code takes the unary union for both datasets. Next, it creates a list of buffered destinations from one dataset that intersect with a buffered destination from the other dataset. It does this for both OSM derived destinations and official destinations, so two lists are created, one populated with OSM destinations and the other Official destinations. Finally, the length of the lists are divided by the length of their corresponding datasets to find the proportion of destinations for each dataset that fall near destinations from the other dataset. 

A method for suitability analysis used a hexagon grid overlaid onto the edge layer to identify the **weight distribution** of destination points located within the city boundaries for Olomouc and Sao Paulo. The distribution of the hexagon layer was uniformly distributed according to the respective crs for each official and OSM layer. The selected diameter for each hexagon was established at 500 meters. Once the hexagon layer was set in place, the validation process identified two conditions: a “True” value if both OSM and Official destination points were present or if both were not present; and a “False” value if one destination point is present (regardless of it being present on the OSM or Official dataset) and not the other.

Upon identifying the location of destination points on the hexagon grid layer, a weight is given according to the percentage of OSM and Official destination points present on each hexagon. Thus, the points present for each individual dataset were then divided by the total sum of destination points present inside each hexagon. Once the percentage for each hexagon was obtained, the validation process produced five additional values. First, the average of True values, which identifies the number of hexagons with a true value divided by the total amount of hexagons. Next, the mean, which is the average of the sum of percentages of hexagons with a true value divided by the total amount of hexagons with a true weight. Third, the median of hexagons with a true weight. Fourth, the true mean, which is the share of hexagons with a true value that contain destinations points divided by the total hexagons with a true weight. And lastly, the true median from hexagons with a true value that contains destinations points.

### Findings and Conclusions

From the edge validation script, the following table composes the results. 

**Edge Validation Indicator Table** 
| City | osm_total_length | osm_edge_count | official_total_length | official_edge_count | osm_area_pct_10 | official_area_pct_10 | osm_length_pct_10 | official_length_pct_10 | osm_area_pct_50 | official_area_pct_50 | osm_length_pct_50 | official_length_pct_50
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Olomouc | 616000 | 14000 | 310000 | 4000 | 57.1% | 90.1% | 66.3% | 93.4% | 82.4% | 96.5% | 90.2% | 98.1% |
| Belfast | 1700000 | 26000 | 1330000 | 19000 | 70.7% | 85.2% | 75.1% | 90.7% | 87.3% | 96.2% | 90.8% | 98.1% | 
| Hong Kong | 7217000 | 108000 | 2911000 | 29000 | 39.9% | 94.0% | 50.9% | 98.9% | 48.4% | 99.4% | 69.6% | 99.9% | 
Table 1

From these indicators, *official_length_pct_10* and *official_length_pct_50* speak to the coverage of OSM data. For all three cities more than 90 percent of the edges from the Official dataset fall within 10 meters of an edge from the OSM derived dataset. This suggests that a high majority of edges from official datasets are accounted for on the OSM derived dataset. For all three cities, more than 98 percent of the edges from the Official dataset fall within 50 meters of an edge from the OSM derived dataset. This suggests that almost every edge from official datasets is either a) accounted for on the OSM derived dataset or b) is concentrated relatively close to edges from the OSM derived dataset. This supports the validity of using OSM derived data, as it closely reflects the official datasets. 

Additionally, when comparing *osm_total_length* and *offiical_total_length*, it is clear that the OSM derived dataset is vastly more comprehensive than the Official data. On average, the OSM derived data has almost twice the coverage of the Official data when using length to compare. This disparity is to be expected, as the OSM derived data includes pedestrian paths. The Official data, however, only includes roads, streets, and other auto-focused paths. The figures created for each city, support the conclusion above. 

![Belfast Street Network Comparison](edge/fig/street-comparison-belfast.png)
Figure 1
This figure shows Belfast. It is possible to see that most of the disparities between datasets occur in areas with high OSM coverage, thereby not affecting the results of the walkability analysis. There are a few edges, however, not accounted for on the urban fringe. These edges account for approximately 2% of the total amount of edges.

![Hong Kong Street Network Comparison](edge/fig/street-comparison-hong_kong.png)
Figure 2
This figure shows Hong Kong. It is possible to see that there are very few areas in which the OSM does not account for edges that exist in the Official data. About 99% of the edges from the Official data are within 10 meters of an edge from the OSM derived data. Only about 0.14% of edges from the Official data are further than 50 meters away from an edge from the OSM derived data.

![Olomouc Street Network Comparison](edge/fig/street-comparison-olomouc.png)
Figure 3
This figure shows Olomouc. It is possible to see that most of the disparities between datasets occur in areas with high OSM coverage, thereby not affecting the results of the walkability analysis. There are a few edges, however, not accounted for on the urban fringe. These edges account for approximately 2% of the total amount of edges. 

**Destination Point Validation Indicator Table**
| city | osm_core_dests_count | official_core_dests_count | osm_dest_count | official_dest_count | osm_buff_overlap_count_10 | official_buff_overlap_count_10 | osm_buff_overlap_count_50 | official_buff_overlap_count_50 | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Olomouc | 51 | 36 | 60 | 50 | 0.2000 | 0.3166 | 0.5000 | 0.5166 | 
| Sao Paulo | 797 | 12 | 1562 | 34 | 0.0172 | 0.0070 | 0.1350 | 0.0108 | 
Table 2

The destination validation script was performed in two cities: Olomouc and Sao Paulo. Initial total counts show vast differences between both cities. Nonetheless, the results suggest that a majority of destination points in the Official dataset are accounted for on the OSM derived dataset. Destination point features include supermarkets and other markets where people are able to buy food, such as a butcher. Both the Official dataset and the OSM derived dataset for the city of Olomouc contain similar destination point features. This is reflected in the results from the buffer overlap count at both, 10 and 50 meters. The overlap count at the 50-meter mark is practically identical at .50 and .51. The Official dataset and the OSM derived dataset for the city of Sao Paulo significantly differ on the total amount of destination points accounted for in each dataset. When comparing the total destination counts, it is clear that the OSM derived dataset, with 1562 destination point features, is vastly more comprehensive than the Official dataset which accounts for 34 destination point features. Nonetheless, the results suggest that a majority of destination points in the Official dataset are accounted for on the OSM derived dataset. In the case of the city of Sao Paulo, the overlap at the 10-meter mark is similar with a variation of .01; at the 50-meter mark the variation is greater, this in part can be attributed to the fact that the percentage of destination points in the provided Official dataset is only 1% of the total destination count at the city core and 2% of the total destination count. 

![Olomouc Destination Comparison](destination/fig/city_destination-comparison-olomouc.png)
Figure 4
Both, the Official dataset and the OSM derived dataset for the city of Olomouc contain similar destination point features. As seen in Fig. 4, the Official dataset provided by the city of Olomouc accounts for 60 destination point features, while the OSM derived dataset accounts for 50 destination point features. 

![Sao Paulo Destination Network Comparison](destination/fig/city_destination-comparison-sao_paulo.png)
Figure 5
The Official dataset for the city of Sao Paulo accounts for only 34 total destination point features, as seen on Fig. 5, the OSM derived dataset contains a richer and more detailed destination point feature total with 1562. 

The results from the hexagon points script provided the weight percentage of hexagons that contain a true value. Both cities: Olomouc and Sao Paulo, present weight percentages of true values above 80%. 

**Hexagon Destination Point Indicator Values**
| City | weight_percentage | osm_mean | official_mean | osm_true_mean | official_true_mean | 
| ---- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Olomouc | 0.8969 | 0.1009 | 0.1050 | 0.2972 | 0.2500 | 
| Sao Paulo | 0.8368 | 0.1628 | 0.0039 | 0.0526 | 0.0046 | 
Table 3

![Olomouc Hex Grid](destination/fig/hexbins-olomouc.png)
Figure 6
At 89.7%, the analysis validates that for the city of Olomouc, as presented on Fig. 6, both OSM and Official datasets account and validate similar point features. This high compatibility is also validated by the results of the OSM mean and Official mean, which only differs by .005; as well as the OSM true mean and the Official true mean with a 4% difference between datasets.

![Sao Paulo Hex Grid](destination/fig/hexbins-sao_paulo.png)
Figure 7
Although the results for the weight percentage for the city of Sao Paulo is at 83.68%, there is a high discrepancy between OSM mean and Official mean results. The 16% difference is driven in part by the total OSM destination count (1562 points) and the Official destination count (34 points). As a robustness test, the points originally taken out of the official data were put back in to the validation analysis. This addition of approximately 900 destinations does not significantly change indicator values. In both scenarios, the true weight value indicates that both OSM and Official datasets contain similar information, either destination points are present within a hexagon boundary or no destination points are present.
