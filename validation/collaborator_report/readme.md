# Collaborator Verification

A report for each city was created by mapping various indicators, defining search terms for destinations, defining the extents of study areas, etc. Through an interative process, the team and collaboraters refined the selected data, terms, and study boundaries, among the other aspects of the report so that the final report most closely represents the characteristics of each city.
