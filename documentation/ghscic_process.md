# Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators (GHSCI) spatial indicator and reporting process

DRAFT IN PROGRESS

## Contents

- Assumed knowledge
    - Basic familiarity with Docker, Git, YAML, some Python
    - Awareness of fundamental geographical and network analysis concepts useful
    - Not assumed, but useful
        - Familiarity with OpenStreetMap and its key:value pair tagging system for classifying data
        - Familiarity with QGIS (or other GIS software) useful for mapping
        - Postgresql and Postgis useful for more advanced data management and querying
- Software installation
    - Git
    - Docker
    - Platform-specific considerations?
- Create and customise project configuration files
    - Project
    - Regions
    - Datasets
        - required:
          - OpenStreetMap
          - Population grid (Global Human Settlements Layer r2022a or later recommended)
        - optional
          - Urban region 
            - Global Human Settlements Layer Urban Centres Database recommended)
              - this also contains additional covariates for urban areas that may be optionally linked
          - GTFS (transport schedule data)
    - Indicators
    - Policies
      - a checklist of policies for reporting purposes
- Set up study region resources
    - Incorporates the following automated processes:
      - Create database for region
      - Create study region boundaries
        - boundary for region of interest (ie. urban and/or policy relevant administrative extent; pending configuration)
        - buffered boundary for data retrieval and analysis to mitigate risk of edge effects
      - Extract OpenStreetMap feature data for region
      - Derive routable pedestrian network and intersections data
      - Set up grid with population estimates for region
      - Compile destinations using OpenStreetMap and/or custom data
      - Derive a dataset of areas of open space
         - Currently focused on 'public open space'
         - It is planned to broaden this to include more flexibility in analysis (green space, blue space, etc)
      - Pre-compute distance relationships for nodes and destinations to facilitate subsequent network analysis
      - Summarise destinations
      - Link urban covariates
      - Analyse service frequency for public transport stops (optional; using GTFS data)
- Analyse neighbourhood indicators for sample points
    - Access to amenities (food market, convenience store, open space typologies, public transport typologies)
    - Daily Living score for access to amenities
    - Walkability index
       - we could optionally calculate z-scores relative to the 25-city results for comparison purposes using their respective mean and sd, and include a comparitive walkability index as sum of those z-scores
- Aggregate point estimates
    - grid area estimates
    - overall city summary estimates
        - distinction between spatial and population-weighted estimates 
- Generate reports
    - Policy and spatial indicator summary report
      - optionally configure for multiple languages
      - currently PDF designed for web distribution (as per 25 city study; same basic design)
      - templates planned for print, and optionally select policy and/or spatial indicators for reporting
    - Planned to incorporate validation reporting with descriptive and analytical summaries
      - currently, validation is to be carried out by users independent of the process
      - previous validation code (reporting and quantitative analysis) requires updating for new process/software
